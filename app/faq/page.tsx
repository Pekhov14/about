            question: "How did you get into programming and why did you choose PHP?",
            answer: "At school, I didn‚Äôt have enough grades in computer science and the teacher asked me to do an assignment for a competition to choose from a list, I decided to try to make a website. Then in 2 weeks I made my first website from HTML and CSS. The teacher said that it was a terrible job for the competition, but he gave a mark. I was interested in this and I began to slowly develop in this. The next year I took second place in the Kharkiv region in the same competition. Then the teacher advised me to continue learning PHP and JS. At university, I tried other languages, but my main one is still PHP.",

I don't have anything against using tools like Golang, Node.js, Python, and others, as I believe that languages and frameworks are tools for solving problems. In the future, I would like my position to be called a senior software developer, not tied to a specific language.",
