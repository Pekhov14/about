            question: "How did you get into programming and why did you first choose PHP?",
            answer: "In school, I didn‚Äôt excel in computer science, so my teacher asked me to complete an assignment from a provided list for a competition. I decided to create a website. Within two weeks, I built my first site using HTML and CSS. Although the teacher considered it unsatisfactory for the competition, I received a grade. This experience piqued my interest, and I gradually delved deeper into programming. The following year, I placed second in the Kharkiv region in the same competition. My teacher then suggested that I continue learning PHP and JavaScript. Throughout university, I explored various programming languages, but PHP remained my primary focus."
